# RailsJsonSeeder

RailsJsonSeeder is a gem to easily read JSON seed data for Rails applications and reflect it in the database.

## Installation
https://rubygems.org/gems/rails_json_seeder

Install the gem and add to the application's Gemfile by executing:
```
$ gem install rails_json_seeder
```

## Quickstart
### Setup
First, call RailsJsonSeeder in the seed.rb file as follows:
```
RailsJsonSeeder.load_seeds('db/seed_config.yml')
```

### Creating a configuration file
`seed_config`
```
seed_file_base_path: 'db/seed_json/' # default value is db/
files:
  'users.json':
    model: User
  'categories.json':
    model: Category
  'books.json':
    model: Book
    dependencies:
      - class: Category
  'user_books.json':
    model: UserBook
    dependencies:
      - class: User
      - class: Book
```

### Creating JSON files
`user_books.json`
```
[
  {
    "first_name": "John",

  }
]
```
`books.json`
```

2. Suggesting Enhancements: Have ideas on how we can do better? Propose enhancements or new features. We're all ears!
3. Code Contributions: Directly contribute to the codebase following the previously mentioned contribution steps. If you're uncertain about something, feel free to ask.
4. Documentation & Examples: Found a typo? Think a section of our documentation could be clearer? Your feedback can make our documentation more user-friendly.
5. Spreading the Word: The more people know about our project, the better. Share our project, write about it, or even give us a shoutout.
